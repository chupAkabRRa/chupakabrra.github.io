Greetings and welcome to my personal blog! I'm really glad to see visitors here! Hope you'll enjoy the content and will not regret the time spent here. Besides I would be extremely happy to see any feedback from you: email, comments, tweets or any other form you prefer - everything is appreciated!

## My goals

*// typedef* has no particular goal or hidden idea behind it. The blog is mostly a collection of facts I discovered and researches I made during my working hours or spare time. As I'm an experienced C/C++ developer which works mainly on system level of different platforms (drivers, low-level system APIs, etc.), most of the content will be somehow related to these topics.

To be more precise, I plan to cover topics like:
* Tricky/advanced features of C++ as a language and what stands behind them;
* Assembly and reverse engineering and why I love them;
* Debugging techniques;
* Mechanics of various parts of operating systems;
* Helpful tools;
* New languages and why they are so special (Rust is gonna be my main focus point here);
* ... many-many more.

It's **important** to understand that I do not pretend to be the novelty of the articles published here! I do not check if this or that material has already been published in the Internet. What I would really like to achieve with *// typedef* is to explain **the very basics** of the topic I cover in an article. Because only uderstanding the basics, the principles of how this or that thing works and organized, you can achieve excellence in your sphere. And impress interviewer during an interview session :)

## About me

I'll be short, I promise:) My name is Dima. I'm a passionate C/C++ developer. Started my professional carrer back in 2010 as a driver developer for Windows platform. Changed couple of roles during all these years. Tried myself as a firmware developer, DBMS engineer, system level programmer, audio/video processing engineer and now back to the role of Windows driver developer again. I love programming, like to study new things and crazy about technology trends.
